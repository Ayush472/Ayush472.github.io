            <h2 id ="chicken">Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
            <p>Poe’s early stream-of-consciousness horror story, unreliable narrator and heart beating under the floorboards and all, is certainly one of the most adapted—and even more often referenced—short stories in popular culture, and which may or may not be the source for all of the hundreds of stories in which a character is tormented by a sound only they can hear.</p>

            <p>Once, while I was walking in Brooklyn, carrying my Bartleby tote bag, a woman in an SUV pulled over (on Atlantic Avenue, folks) to excitedly wave at me and yell “Melville!&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;Melville!” Which is all you really need to know about that.</p>

        <h2 id="steak">Ambrose Bierce</h2>
        <p>I will leave it to Kurt Vonnegut, who famously wrote, “I consider anybody a twerp who hasn’t read the greatest American short story, which is “Occurrence&nbsp;at&nbsp;Owl&nbsp;Creek&nbsp;Bridge,” by Ambrose Bierce. It isn’t remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like “Sophisticated&nbsp;Lady” by Duke Ellington or the Franklin&nbsp;stove.”</p>
